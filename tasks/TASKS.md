## Remaining Tasks

### [DONE] T-042: Save System

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `meta` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-036 |
| **Target Files** | `src/save/SaveManager.ts`, `src/save/SaveSchema.ts` |
| **Description** | Implement localStorage-based save system. SaveSchema defines shape: `{ version: number, metaCurrency: number, unlocks: string[], settings: {...}, bestRun: {...} }`. SaveManager provides: `save(data)`, `load(): SaveData`, `reset()`. Version field enables future migrations. Auto-save on run end. Load on game start. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Data persists across browser sessions. Schema is validated on load. Corrupted data is handled gracefully (reset to defaults). Version migration path exists. |

**Implementation note**: `SaveSchema.ts` defines `SaveData` with version, metaCurrency, unlocks, settings (volumes + cameraSensitivity), and bestRun (rooms/enemies/shards). `SaveManager.ts` provides save/load/reset with localStorage, JSON validation, version migration path, auto-save on `RUN_ENDED` (awards 50% shards as meta-currency). Wired into `Game.ts` after EventBus construction. Corrupted/missing data resets to defaults gracefully.

---

### [DONE] T-043: Object Pool (Enhancement)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `infrastructure` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-001 |
| **Target Files** | `src/engine/ObjectPool.ts` |
| **Description** | Enhance the existing ObjectPool with `preWarm(count)` for upfront allocation at scene start. Currently used by CubeSentinel projectiles and ParticleSystem. Extend usage to damage numbers and pickups. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Pre-warm creates specified count upfront. All poolable systems use ObjectPool. No runtime allocation during combat. |

**Implementation note**: Added `preWarm(count)` method to `ObjectPool`. Converted `PickupSystem` to pool `THREE.Mesh` instances (pre-warms 30, acquires on spawn, releases on collect/despawn). Converted `DamageNumbers` from manual DOM pooling to `ObjectPool<HTMLDivElement>` (pre-warms 20, releases after animation timeout). All poolable combat systems now use the shared ObjectPool class with zero runtime allocation during combat.

---

### [DONE] T-044: Math Utilities

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `infrastructure` |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Depends On** | None |
| **Target Files** | `src/utils/math.ts`, `src/utils/timer.ts`, `src/utils/constants.ts` |
| **Description** | Create utility functions. math.ts: `lerp`, `clamp`, `randomRange`, `randomInt`, `degToRad`, `radToDeg`, `distanceVec3`, `lerpVec3`. timer.ts: `CooldownTimer` class with `start(duration)`, `update(dt)`, `isReady()`, `reset()`. constants.ts: `FIXED_TIMESTEP`, `PLAYER_WALK_SPEED`, etc. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | All math functions produce correct results. CooldownTimer works. Constants are exported and typed. |

**Implementation note**: Created three utility files. `math.ts`: `lerp`, `clamp`, `randomRange`, `randomInt`, `degToRad`, `radToDeg`, `distanceVec3` (uses temp Vector3 to avoid allocation), `lerpVec3` (writes to `out` parameter). `timer.ts`: `CooldownTimer` class with `start(duration)`, `update(dt)`, `isReady()`, `reset()`, plus `progress` and `remaining` getters. `constants.ts`: ~70 typed constants grouped by domain (timing, movement, stats, stamina costs, dodge, parry, heal, light/heavy attack, camera, input, world, pickups, enemy, physics) extracted from hardcoded values across the codebase.

---

### [DONE] T-045: Game Config

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `infrastructure` |
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Depends On** | None |
| **Target Files** | `src/config/gameConfig.ts`, `src/config/renderConfig.ts` |
| **Description** | Create centralized configuration files. gameConfig.ts: all gameplay tuning values (player speeds, damage values, stamina costs, timing windows) as a typed const object. renderConfig.ts: resolution scale, shadow quality, outline width, post-processing toggles. All values referenced by systems instead of hardcoded numbers. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | All tuning values are in config files. No magic numbers in gameplay code. Changing a config value changes behavior without code changes. |

**Implementation note**: Created `src/config/gameConfig.ts` with a structured `GAME_CONFIG` const object grouping all gameplay tuning values into 14 domains: timing, player movement, stats, stamina costs, dodge, parry, heal, light attack, heavy attack, camera, input, world, pickups, enemy, and physics. Created `src/config/renderConfig.ts` with `RENDER_CONFIG` covering resolution scaling, clear color, cel-shading ramp (thresholds + intensities), outline parameters (width, depth/normal thresholds), camera clipping, and post-processing toggles. Both exported as `as const` with derived types. Existing `src/utils/constants.ts` (from T-044) provides flat re-exports for backward compatibility.

## Open Bugs

### [DONE] T-BUG-001: Enemy Wall Collision

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-014, T-020, T-013 |
| **Target Files** | `src/enemies/BaseEnemy.ts`, `src/world/EncounterManager.ts`, `src/app/Game.ts` |
| **Description** | Enemies walk through arena walls (especially Cube Sentinels retreating). Add sphere collider to BaseEnemy and resolve against wall AABBs after each movement update. EncounterManager needs access to current room's wall colliders. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Enemies cannot walk through walls. Retreat stops at wall boundaries. Enemy movement slides along walls. |

**Implementation note**: Added `SphereCollider` to `BaseEnemy` (radius sourced from hurtbox shape) with `resolveWallCollisions(walls)` method using `testSphereVsAABB` + `resolveCollision` from CollisionSystem — same approach as player wall collision. `EncounterManager` stores wall colliders via `setWallColliders()` and calls `resolveWallCollisions` on each alive enemy after its `update()` call. `Game.ts` passes wall colliders from `TestArena`/`RoomModule` to EncounterManager at construction, on room transition, and on hub return.

## Development Gap Analysis

> Produced at 43/46 tasks complete. The game has a functional combat loop with 2 enemy types, wave encounters, zone progression scaffolding, and a death/retry cycle. The following gaps prevent the game from being a satisfying playable experience.

### Critical Gaps
| Gap | Impact | Current State |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| **Enemy Variety** | Runs feel identical — only 2 of 6 designed enemies exist. No bosses. | TriangleShard + CubeSentinel only |
| **Weapons** | No player choice or build variety — 1 weapon, no loading from data, no swapping | Fracture Blade hardcoded |
| **Audio** | Silent game — no SFX, music, or ambient. Pillar 1 requires audio telegraphs | Zero audio code exists |
| **Game Flow** | No title screen, no hub, no pause. Game boots directly into combat | Death screen only |

### Major Gaps
| Gap | Impact | Current State |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| **Room Content** | 1 room JSON out of 5+ designed per zone. Every room is the same square | atrium-room-square only |
| **Zone Integration** | ZoneGenerator exists but isn't wired into room transitions | handleRoomTransition hardcoded |
| **Environment Hazards** | Room schema supports hazards but no system processes them | No HazardSystem |
| **Meta-Progression** | Save/load works but no unlock shop, no hub, no spending of meta-currency | SaveManager + RunState only |
| **Encounter Variety** | 5 encounters for zone 1 using 2 enemy types. No difficulty 7+ encounters | data/encounters/zone1-encounters.json |

### Moderate Gaps
| Gap | Impact | Current State |
|-----|--------|---------------|
| **UI Missing** | No pause menu, settings, boss health bar, weapon indicator, controls help | HUD + death screen only |
| **Damage Pipeline** | No defense/armor, no critical hits, parry buff not in calc | calculateDamage is base * multiplier |
| **Combat AI** | Max-2-attackers rule from spec not enforced. All enemies rush player | Each enemy AI is independent |
| **Polish** | No low-HP vignette, no screen flash on hit, death anim is basic | Particles + shake only |

---

## Phase 6 — Gameplay Expansion

> 40 tasks expanding the game from vertical-slice to full playable experience.
> Enemy content, weapons, rooms, game flow, audio, meta-progression, UI, and polish.

### [DONE] T-046: Spiral Dancer Enemy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` + `data` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-020, T-021 |
| **Target Files** | `src/enemies/spiral-dancer/SpiralDancer.ts`, `src/enemies/spiral-dancer/states.ts`, `data/enemies/spiral-dancer.json` |
| **Description** | Implement the Spiral Dancer — fast melee skirmisher that orbits the player. Helix mesh (TubeGeometry along spiral curve, ~1.5m tall, purple #9944cc). FSM: idle → orbit (circle player at 5–7m, 8 m/s) → dart_strike (350ms telegraph, 150ms dash through player, 500ms recovery, 12 dmg) → whip_lash (300ms telegraph, 200ms 3m arc, 8 dmg) → cooldown → staggered. Register in EnemyRegistry. Side-effect import in Game.ts. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Enemy spawns, orbits player, performs both attacks with visible telegraphs, takes damage, dies with shatter effect. |
| **Verification** | Spawn via debug encounter. Observe orbit movement and attack patterns. Verify hitbox alignment. |

**Implementation note**: Created `data/enemies/spiral-dancer.json` with 40 HP, 8 m/s moveSpeed, 15 poise, 2 attacks (dart_strike: 350ms telegraph, 150ms dash at 30 m/s, 12 dmg; whip_lash: 300ms telegraph, 200ms 3m arc, 8 dmg). `SpiralDancer.ts` extends BaseEnemy with helix mesh via custom HelixCurve (3 turns, 1.5m tall, 0.25m radius) + TubeGeometry, purple #9944cc cel-shaded material. 6 FSM states in `states.ts`: idle (aggro range 12m), orbit (circles player at 6m radius using angular velocity, attacks after 1.5s cooldown), dart_strike (dash through player), whip_lash (close-range arc), cooldown (800ms), staggered (1200ms). Registered in EnemyRegistry via side-effect import in Game.ts.

### [DONE] T-047: Monolith Brute Enemy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` + `data` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-020, T-021 |
| **Target Files** | `src/enemies/monolith-brute/MonolithBrute.ts`, `src/enemies/monolith-brute/states.ts`, `data/enemies/monolith-brute.json` |
| **Description** | Implement the Monolith Brute — slow heavy tank. BoxGeometry 0.8×2.5×0.4m, dark stone #555566. FSM: idle → chase (2 m/s) → slam (800ms telegraph, 300ms active, 3m radius, 30 dmg, 1000ms recovery) → sweep (600ms telegraph, 400ms 180° arc 3.5m, 20 dmg) → stomp (500ms telegraph, 200ms 2m radius, 15 dmg) → cooldown → staggered (expose glowing crack, 1.5x damage taken for 2s). HP 120, poise 100. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Enemy advances slowly, picks from 3 attacks, long telegraphs are clearly visible, stagger exposes vulnerability window. |
| **Verification** | Spawn via debug encounter. Test all 3 attacks. Verify stagger vulnerability applies 1.5x damage. |

**Implementation note:** Created MonolithBrute extending BaseEnemy with BoxGeometry 0.8×2.5×0.8, #555566 cel material. 7 FSM states (idle, chase, slam, sweep, stomp, cooldown, staggered). Vulnerability mechanic: `takeDamage()` override applies `damageMultiplier` (1.5x during stagger, controlled by BruteStaggeredState). Crack glow uses orange color (#FF9933) on `uBaseColor` uniform. Registered in EnemyRegistry + side-effect import in Game.ts.

### [DONE] T-048: Lattice Weaver Enemy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` + `data` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-020, T-021, T-061 |
| **Target Files** | `src/enemies/lattice-weaver/LatticeWeaver.ts`, `src/enemies/lattice-weaver/states.ts`, `data/enemies/lattice-weaver.json` |
| **Description** | Implement the Lattice Weaver — area denial support enemy. EdgesGeometry wireframe cube (~1m, teal #44aaaa). Floats 0.5m above ground (sinusoidal bob). FSM: idle → position (moves to strategic point between player and other enemies) → web_deploy (600ms telegraph, places 4m radius damage zone on ground, 5 dmg/s, 8s duration, max 2 zones) → node_burst (400ms telegraph, ring of 6 small projectiles, 8 dmg each) → cooldown → alone_aggro (speeds up when last enemy alive) → staggered. HP 35. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Enemy positions strategically, deploys visible ground hazard zones, fires ring projectiles, zones deal damage over time to player, becomes aggressive when alone. |
| **Verification** | Spawn with other enemies. Verify zone placement, DOT damage, aggro behavior change when alone. |

**Implementation note**: EdgesGeometry wireframe cube (~1m) with cel material + LineSegments overlay at teal #44aaaa. Sinusoidal bob (0.15m amplitude, 2Hz) at 0.5m float height. 7 FSM states: idle, position (maintains 7m range, chooses attacks on 2.5s timer), web_deploy (600ms telegraph → deploys 4m radius ground zone), node_burst (400ms telegraph → fires ring of 6 sphere projectiles), cooldown (1.2s), alone_aggro (1.5x speed, 1.5s attack interval when last alive), staggered (1s). Zone system: max 2 active zones, 5dmg/s via hitbox recycling every 1s (new attackInstanceId for repeated DOT), 8s duration with pulse opacity + fade-out. Projectile ObjectPool (8 slots). EncounterManager passes scene ref and aliveCount callback via setScene()/setAliveCountFn(). T-061 dependency soft — zones are self-contained enemy mechanics, not HazardSystem.

### [DONE] T-049: Boss — The Aggregate (Data + Base)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` + `data` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-020, T-021, T-022 |
| **Target Files** | `src/enemies/aggregate-boss/AggregateBoss.ts`, `src/enemies/aggregate-boss/states.ts`, `data/enemies/aggregate-boss.json` |
| **Description** | Implement Zone 1 boss: The Aggregate — a cluster of fused triangles forming a shifting humanoid silhouette. Mesh: group of 12–16 ConeGeometry triangles arranged in humanoid shape, dark red #993333. HP 300. 3 phases based on HP thresholds: Phase 1 (100–66% HP): melee swipes (500ms telegraph, 250ms active, 20 dmg, 3m arc). Phase 2 (66–33%): adds a charge attack (700ms telegraph, 8m dash, 25 dmg) + triangle scatter (launches 4 triangles outward). Phase 3 (<33%): faster attacks, reduced telegraph by 100ms. No adds-splitting in this task (see T-050). |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Boss spawns with cluster mesh, transitions between 3 phases at HP thresholds, each phase adds attacks, telegraphs are clearly visible, boss has unique death effect. |
| **Verification** | Spawn in boss arena room. Fight through all 3 phases. Verify phase transitions. Check damage values. |

**Implementation note**: 14-cone humanoid cluster mesh with sinusoidal jitter. 8 FSM states (idle, chase, melee_swipe, charge, triangle_scatter, cooldown, staggered, phase_transition). Phase-aware attack selection in chase state. CubeSentinel-style ObjectPool projectile system for scatter attack. Enhanced death effect with 14 cone shatter pieces (slower, wider spread). EncounterManager updated with setScene() check.

### [DONE] T-050: Boss — The Aggregate (Split Mechanic)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` |
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Depends On** | T-049 |
| **Target Files** | `src/enemies/aggregate-boss/AggregateBoss.ts`, `src/enemies/aggregate-boss/states.ts` |
| **Description** | Add split/reform mechanic to The Aggregate. In Phase 2+, on stagger: boss splits into 3–5 independent TriangleShard minions for 8 seconds. Minions have 15 HP each. After 8s or all minions killed, boss reforms at center of remaining minions. Boss HP does not regen during split. If boss HP < 33% during split, reforms immediately after 1 minion killed. Visual: triangles detach and scatter, reform animates them back together. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Boss splits on stagger, minions are real TriangleShards that can be fought, boss reforms after timer or all killed, HP preserved across split/reform. |
| **Verification** | Trigger stagger in Phase 2. Verify minion spawning. Kill some minions, verify reform. |

**Implementation note**: 2 new FSM states (split, reform) + modified staggered state. AggregateBoss spawns real TriangleShard instances with 15 HP via preloaded JSON data, registers them with CombatSystem and StaggerSystem independently of EncounterManager. Boss is invulnerable during split (hurtbox unregistered, takeDamage returns early). Reform calculates center of remaining alive minions, kills/disposes all, repositions boss, re-registers hurtbox. Reform animation spreads cones outward then converges over 1s. Phase 3 early reform triggers after first minion killed. 5s cooldown prevents immediate re-split. EncounterManager passes combatSystem/staggerSystem refs via setSpawnSystems().

### [DONE] T-051: Weapon Data Loader

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` + `data` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-024, T-017, T-040 |
| **Target Files** | `src/combat/WeaponSystem.ts`, `src/combat/WeaponData.ts`, `src/player/states/LightAttackState.ts`, `src/player/states/HeavyAttackState.ts` |
| **Description** | Create `WeaponData.ts` interface matching `data/weapons/*.json` schema. Extend WeaponSystem with `loadWeapon(id): Promise<WeaponData>` and `getEquipped(): WeaponData`. Refactor LightAttackState and HeavyAttackState to read damage, range, stamina cost, combo hits, attack speed from the equipped WeaponData instead of hardcoded values. Load `fracture-blade.json` as default on game start. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Player attacks use values from weapon JSON. Changing weapon JSON changes in-game behavior. WeaponSystem caches loaded data. |
| **Verification** | Modify fracture-blade.json damage values. Reload game. Verify damage numbers change. |

**Implementation note**: Created `WeaponData.ts` interface matching weapon JSON schema. Extended `WeaponSystem` with `loadWeapon(id)` (fetch + cache), `equipWeapon(id)` (load + equip + update STAMINA_COSTS), and `getEquipped()` (returns current WeaponData, defaults to fracture-blade stats). Refactored `LightAttackState` and `HeavyAttackState` to read hitbox radius/arc, combo count, and attack speed scaling from `ctx.weaponSystem.getEquipped()` on state enter. Attack speed inversely scales all phase timings. Heavy attack multiplier range derived from `weapon.heavyMultiplier`. Game.ts calls `equipWeapon('fracture-blade')` on startup before first encounter.

---

### [DONE] T-052: Edge Spike Weapon

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `data` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-051 |
| **Target Files** | `data/weapons/edge-spike.json` |
| **Description** | Create Edge Spike weapon data: fast, short-range. baseDamage 10, heavyMultiplier 1.8, attackSpeed 1.4, range 1.8m, staggerDamage 8, comboHits 3 (3-hit light combo), staminaCostLight 8, staminaCostHeavy 18. hitboxShape "arc", hitboxSize { radius: 1.8, angle: 90 }. unlockCost 50. Description: "A needle of compressed edge. Strikes fast, reaches short." |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | JSON validates against WeaponData schema. Values are balanced (faster but less damage than Fracture Blade). |
| **Verification** | Load weapon via WeaponSystem.loadWeapon. Verify all fields parse correctly. |

**Implementation note**: Created `data/weapons/edge-spike.json` conforming to WeaponData schema. All values match task spec exactly. Faster (1.4x attack speed) and shorter range (1.8m) than Fracture Blade (1.0x, 2.5m), lower damage (10 vs 18) but 3-hit combo and lower stamina costs.

---

### [DONE] T-053: Void Cleaver Weapon

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `data` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-051 |
| **Target Files** | `data/weapons/void-cleaver.json` |
| **Description** | Create Void Cleaver weapon data: slow, heavy damage. baseDamage 28, heavyMultiplier 2.5, attackSpeed 0.7, range 3.2m, staggerDamage 25, comboHits 1 (no light combo), staminaCostLight 18, staminaCostHeavy 35. hitboxShape "arc", hitboxSize { radius: 3.2, angle: 150 }. unlockCost 80. Description: "A slab of absence given weight. Each swing carves meaning from the air." |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | JSON validates against WeaponData schema. Values are balanced (high risk/reward, stamina-hungry). |
| **Verification** | Load weapon via WeaponSystem.loadWeapon. Verify all fields parse correctly. |

**Implementation note**: Created `data/weapons/void-cleaver.json` conforming to WeaponData schema. Slow (0.7x attack speed), long range (3.2m), high damage (28 base, 2.5x heavy = 70), massive stagger (25), but stamina-hungry (18 light / 35 heavy) with no combo (1 hit). 150-degree wide arc. Unlock cost 80.

---

### [DONE] T-054: Weapon Swap System

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-051 |
| **Target Files** | `src/combat/WeaponSystem.ts`, `src/app/InputManager.ts`, `src/player/PlayerController.ts` |
| **Description** | Allow player to carry 2 weapons and swap between them. Add `SWAP_WEAPON` action to InputManager (key: 1/2 or scroll wheel). WeaponSystem tracks primary and secondary weapon IDs. Swapping is instant but only allowed in idle/run states. On swap: emit `WEAPON_SWAPPED` event with new weapon data. HUD listens to update weapon indicator (see T-075). |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Player can swap between 2 weapons mid-run. Swap blocked during attacks/dodge/heal. Attack stats change immediately on swap. |
| **Verification** | Equip 2 different weapons. Swap. Verify damage numbers match new weapon. Attempt swap during attack (should be blocked). |

**Implementation Note**: InputManager already had `swapWeapon` bound to F key. Added dual-weapon tracking (primary/secondary) to WeaponSystem with `swapWeapon()`, `equipSecondary()`, `getSecondary()`, `hasSecondary()`. Swap check lives in `PlayerStateMachine.update()` (gated to idle/run states) rather than PlayerController (which handles movement only). WEAPON_SWAPPED event added to EventBus. Game.ts equips edge-spike as default secondary.

### [DONE] T-055: Weapon Pickup During Runs

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `gameplay` + `interactions` |
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Depends On** | T-054 |
| **Target Files** | `src/interactions/WeaponPickup.ts`, `src/interactions/PickupSystem.ts`, `src/world/EncounterManager.ts` |
| **Description** | After clearing a room, spawn a random weapon pickup from the unlock pool. WeaponPickup: floating weapon mesh with glow, press E to pick up. If player has 2 weapons, picking up replaces currently equipped (dropped weapon despawns). Spawn at room center. Weapon type randomly selected from unlocked weapons. Only spawns if `Math.random() < 0.4` (40% chance per room clear). |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Weapon pickup appears after some room clears. Player can interact to equip. Old weapon replaced if inventory full. |
| **Verification** | Clear 5+ rooms. Verify weapon pickups appear ~40% of the time. Pick up weapon, verify it equips. |

**Implementation Note**: Created `src/interactions/WeaponPickup.ts` — self-contained system that listens for `ROOM_CLEARED`, rolls 40% chance, spawns floating octahedron with glow pulse at room center. Press E within 2.5m to pick up. If player has empty secondary slot, equips there; otherwise replaces primary. Added `roomCenter` to `ROOM_CLEARED` event payload (computed from spawn point average in EncounterManager). Added `WEAPON_PICKUP_COLLECTED` event. Integrated in Game.ts (construct, update, dispose).

### [DONE] T-056: Room Module — atrium-hall-straight

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `data` + `world` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-027 |
| **Target Files** | `data/rooms/atrium-hall-straight.json` |
| **Description** | Create JSON for the tutorial corridor room. 20m×8m floor, 3m walls. 2 spawn points at mid-corridor flanks. Player entry at south. Single exit at north. 2 decorative column props at 1/3 and 2/3 length. No hazards. Zone: "shattered-atrium". This is the opening room for Zone 1 runs. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | JSON conforms to RoomModuleData schema. RoomAssembler builds it without errors. Spawn points are reachable. |
| **Verification** | Load via AssetLoader + RoomAssembler. Walk through room. Verify dimensions and spawn positions. |

**Implementation note**: Created `data/rooms/atrium-hall-straight.json` — 8×3×20 corridor (x=width, z=length). 2 spawn points at mid-corridor flanks (x=±3), player entry at south (z=-9.5), single north exit (z=9.5, locked). 2 pillar-cracked props at ~1/3 and 2/3 length. No hazards. Already registered in Zone1Config (line 20).

### [DONE] T-057: Room Module — atrium-junction-T

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `data` + `world` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-027 |
| **Target Files** | `data/rooms/atrium-junction-T.json` |
| **Description** | Create JSON for the T-intersection room. 12m×16m floor, 3m walls. T-shape: main corridor 12m wide, branch extends 8m to the right. 3 spawn points (center, left alcove, right branch end). Player entry at south. 2 exits: north + east. 1 static-discharge hazard at the junction corner (radius 1.5m, 5 dmg/tick, 1s interval). |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | JSON conforms to RoomModuleData. Room builds correctly with T-shaped walls. Both exits functional. |
| **Verification** | Load room. Walk all paths. Verify spawn point accessibility and exit door positions. |

> **Implementation note**: Created `data/rooms/atrium-junction-T.json` — 12×16m bounding box, 3m walls, geometry `prefab:atrium-junction-T`. 3 spawn points positioned at center, left alcove, and right branch end. North + east exits. Static-discharge hazard at junction corner. Note: RoomAssembler currently builds rectangular perimeter walls from `size`; the `geometry` field is declared but not yet parsed for T-shaped wall generation.

| **Work Type** | `data` + `world` |
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Depends On** | T-027 |
| **Target Files** | `data/rooms/atrium-boss-arena.json` |
| **Description** | Create JSON for the Zone 1 boss arena. 20m×20m open floor, 3m walls. 4 corner pillars (props). Single spawn point at room center. Player entry at south. No exits (boss arena — game handles zone transition on boss death). No hazards. Zone: "shattered-atrium". |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | JSON conforms to schema. Large open room with 4 pillar props. Spawn point centered. |
| **Verification** | Load room. Verify dimensions suit boss combat (enough space for dodge rolls and boss attacks). |

**Implementation note**: Created `data/rooms/atrium-boss-arena.json` — 20×20×3 arena with single center spawn, south player entry at (0, 0, -9.5), no exits, no hazards, 4 `pillar-cracked` props at corners (±8, 0, ±8). Follows existing room module schema conventions.

|-------|-------|
| **Work Type** | `world` |
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Depends On** | T-030, T-056, T-057, T-058 |
| **Target Files** | `src/app/Game.ts`, `src/world/ZoneGenerator.ts` |
| **Description** | Wire ZoneGenerator into Game.ts room transitions. On game start: generate a ZoneLayout via `ZoneGenerator.generate('shattered-atrium')`. Store the layout in Game. `handleRoomTransition` loads the next room/encounter from the layout instead of hardcoded values. Track current room index via RunState.advanceRoom(). Load encounter JSON from `data/encounters/zone1-encounters.json` matching the layout's encounterId. On last room: spawn boss encounter (or final wave). |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Each run generates a different room sequence. Rooms load from layout. Encounters match layout. Room index advances correctly. |
| **Verification** | Start 3 runs. Verify room order differs. Check console logs show ZoneGenerator output. |

**Implementation notes:** Replaced hardcoded room/encounter loading in Game.ts with ZoneGenerator-driven flow. Added `startZoneRun(zoneId)` which loads encounter JSON, generates a ZoneLayout, and loads the first room. `handleRoomTransition` now advances via `runState.advanceRoom()` and loads next room/encounter from the layout. Added `loadRoomFromLayout(index)` helper with fallback for missing room JSON (e.g. `atrium-balcony`). `handleReturnToHub` now generates a fresh layout on retry. Zone completion restarts the zone (future: victory screen).

Register all in Zone1Config encounter pool with appropriate weights. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | All 5 new encounters parse and spawn correctly. Zone1Config includes new encounters in pool. Difficulty curve can reach them. |
| **Verification** | ZoneGenerator produces layouts that include new encounters at appropriate difficulty levels. |

**Implementation note**: Added 5 encounters to `zone1-encounters.json`: `z1-dancer-ambush` (diff 4), `z1-brute-intro` (diff 6), `z1-mixed-pressure` (diff 7), `z1-gauntlet` (diff 8, 3 waves), `z1-boss` (diff 10). Registered all in `Zone1Config` encounter pool. Updated difficulty curve to `[1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10]` so the zone ramps through all new encounters including the boss finale.

| **Description** | Convert HitboxManager to pool Hitbox objects instead of creating new ones per attack. Pool the `alreadyHit: Set` objects — clear instead of allocating new. Pre-warm 20 hitbox objects. On createHitbox(): acquire from pool, populate fields. On removeHitbox(): release back to pool, clear alreadyHit set. Reduces GC pressure during intense combat with many simultaneous attacks. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | No new Hitbox allocations during combat. Pool stats visible in debug panel (T-084). Hit detection unchanged. |
| **Verification** | Fight enemies. Monitor debug panel pool stats. Verify hitbox pool reuses objects. Verify no hit detection regressions. |
